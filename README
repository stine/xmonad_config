This is a collection of configuration files for my xmonad-based desktop.

Files should typically be put into these locations:
~/.xmobarrc
~/.xmonad/
~/.xsession
/usr/share/xsessions/custom.desktop
/usr/bin/dmenu_path

Will need the following installed via yum:
xmonad
xmobar
rxvt-unicode
gajim
stalonetray
xscreensaver
dwm-user
